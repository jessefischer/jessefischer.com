		<h1>about</h1>

		<p>
			<strong>Jesse Fischer</strong> is a Brooklyn-based pianist, composer, and producer. Known for
			his warm, soulful touch and emphasis on melody, groove, storytelling and
			emotion, his unique voice combines elements of his own Jewish heritage with
			music of the African diaspora, jazz, hip-hop, indie, and singer-songwriter
			genres. A two-time <strong>ASCAP Plus Award</strong> winner, Fischer has performed with many
			notables in the jazz, pop, and world music scenes, including <strong>Mino Cinélu</strong>,
			<strong>Sarah Elizabeth Charles</strong>, <strong>Becca Stevens</strong>, <strong>Grace Kelly</strong>, <strong>Lakecia Benjamin</strong>, <strong>Deva
			Mahal</strong>, and <strong>Takuya Kuroda</strong>. He has released several records as a leader,
			including <strong><em>Day Dreamer</em></strong> (Ropeadope, 2015), his Herbie Hancock/Head Hunters
			tribute <strong><em>Vein Melter</em></strong> (Tru Thoughts, 2015) — jointly created with
			producer/multi-instrumentalist <strong>Sly5thAve</strong> — and most recently, the <strong><em>Cross
			Currents</em></strong> EP (self-released, 2019), featuring drummer <strong>Nate Smith</strong> and
			saxophonist <strong>Marcus Strickland</strong>. He is also a core member of the groundbreaking
			Brooklyn Afro-pop/jazz fusion collective <strong>Ajoyo</strong> and producer &amp; engineer of
			their sophomore release, <strong><em>War Chant</em></strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Fischer’s newest project <strong><em>Resilience</em></strong>, out August 7, 2020, is a full-length album of original compositions
			exploring deeper connections between modern jazz, Jewish and African
			traditional music, and European classical music, and features special guests
			including <strong>Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah</strong>, <strong>Becca
			Stevens</strong>, <strong>Gregoire Marét</strong>, <strong>Sarah Elizabeth
			Charles</strong>, <strong>Mino Cin&eacute;lu</strong>, and young lion
			<strong>Morgan Guerin</strong>, along with his working group of <strong>Obed
			Calvaire</strong> (drums), <strong>Godwin Louis</strong> (alto &amp; soprano
			sax), <strong>Billy Buss</strong> (trumpet), <strong>David Cutler</strong>
			(bass), <strong>Jordan Peters</strong> (guitar), and <strong>Keita
			Ogawa</strong> (percussion). With seven instrumentals and two songs with
			lyrics penned by Fischer himself with co-writers <strong>Sarah Elizabeth
			Charles</strong> and <strong>May Cheung</strong>, the album is both deeply
			personal and necessarily political, responding to the wave of white
			nationalism, authoritarianism, and hate that has swept the globe in recent
			years. The compositions on <strong><em>Resilience</em></strong> emerged
			after a period of intense self-reflection, and range emotionally from
			despair to resistance to optimism to celebration.
		</p>

		<p>
			Fischer has brought his unique voice as a
			composer and bandleader to stages around the world. With over 700,000 plays on
			Spotify to date, his music has been featured on Spotify’s flagship editorial
			playlists like <strong>State of Jazz</strong>, <strong>Butter</strong>, and <strong>Fresh Finds</strong>, as well as taste-making
			radio shows including <strong>Gilles Peterson</strong> (BBC Radio 6), <strong>Jeremy Sole</strong> (KCRW),
			Miller Time with legendary bassist/producer <strong>Marcus Miller</strong> (Sirius/XM) and
			<strong>Wicked Jazz Sounds</strong> (Amsterdam).
		</p>

		<p>
			Ever prolific and versatile, Fischer also has many years’ experience as a
			producer and songwriter in the indie-pop, soul, and singer-songwriter genres.
			Fischer’s credits as a producer, engineer, and songwriter include <strong>Morgan
			James</strong>, <strong>Laura Izibor</strong>, <strong>Elise Testone</strong>, <strong>Jasmine Cephas Jones</strong>, <strong>Samora Pinderhughes</strong>,
			<strong>Justin Brown</strong>, <strong>BIGYUKI</strong>, and many others. Fischer’s remixes for artists such as
			<strong>Emily King</strong>, <strong>Gregory Porter</strong>, <strong>Hiatus Kaiyote</strong>, <strong>Space Captain</strong>, and <strong>Takuya Kuroda</strong>
			have been spun on dancefloors and parties all across the globe, from Singapore
			to Amsterdam to South Africa to London. He is also a passionate educator with
			experience teaching music and music production to young people of all ages, in
			both a private and classroom setting.
