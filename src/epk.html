				Fischer’s newest project <strong><em>Resilience</em></strong>, released August 2020,
				is a full-length album of original compositions
				exploring deeper connections between modern jazz, Jewish and African
				traditional music, and European classical music, and features special guests
				including <strong>Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah</strong>, <strong>Becca
				Stevens</strong>, <strong>Gregoire Marét</strong>, <strong>Sarah Elizabeth
				Charles</strong>, <strong>Mino Cin&eacute;lu</strong>, and young lion
				<strong>Morgan Guerin</strong>, along with his working group of <strong>Obed
				Calvaire</strong> (drums), <strong>Godwin Louis</strong> (alto &amp; soprano
				sax), <strong>Billy Buss</strong> (trumpet), <strong>David Cutler</strong>
				(bass), <strong>Jordan Peters</strong> (guitar), and <strong>Keita
				Ogawa</strong> (percussion). With seven instrumentals and two songs with
				lyrics penned by Fischer himself with co-writers <strong>Sarah Elizabeth
				Charles</strong> and <strong>May Cheung</strong>, the album is both deeply
				personal and necessarily political, responding to the wave of white
				nationalism, authoritarianism, and hate that has swept the globe in recent
				years. The compositions on <strong><em>Resilience</em></strong> emerged
				after a period of intense self-reflection, and range emotionally from
				despair to resistance to optimism to celebration.
